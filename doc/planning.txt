1. Create classes (parent and child)
    - Clothes is the parent
        - 3 fields:
            String name;
                GenderEnum genderType;
                QualityEnum qualityMark;
    - Separate child those extends from Clothes!
        - Children are: T-Shirt, Shirt, Pants, Jacket (or Coat), Shoes, Socks
            they all have different and special field, those fields belongs to only one of them!!!  --> DONE

2. creating test file with some different kind of examples! --> DONE

3. Reading file (into a map!)
    Key: name of the clothes
    Value: the Instance itself (with all fields!!!) --> DONE

4. With reading the file actually I am ready with the first 5 tasks! --> READY with the hardest part!!! HALLELUJAH ...

5. Create a method for counting all clothes I had!
    - first way count the items one by one iterating through all list (or first create one list of all lists!)
    - iterating through the map, and counting items! --> I choose this one, bigger challenge for me! --> DONE

6. to check the remaining stuffs by quality codes (how many I kept) I used the separate list (that includes items 1by1) --> DONE

7. using for printing all previously collected data's! --> DONE
